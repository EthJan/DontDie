        <h1>About Safelink</h1>
            <p>Over the past 50 years, the number of disasters worldwide experienced a fivefold increase, affecting millions of people each year. These natural disasters come in different ways and come without warning, leaving communities in urgent need of resources, aid, and volunteers. Thatâ€™s where the idea for Safelink came from. We realized there was a need for a platform connecting everyday citizens to critical information about natural disasters.</p>
            <p>Introducing Safelink: We connect people to critical information and volunteering opportunities in real-time. Whether you're affected by an event or ready to lend a helping hand, Safelink makes it easy to see, report, and respond to natural disasters around the world.</p>
